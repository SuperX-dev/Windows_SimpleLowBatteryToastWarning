# Windows_SimpleLowBatteryWarning
 Some Only Windows scripts so you can receive a not so intrusive Low Battery Warning
 
 <b>Only for Windows 8, 8.1, 10 and 11</b>
 
 <h1>How it Works</h1>
 
 This is a little Visual Basic Script that will verify if the battery is lower then 20% every 5 minutes.
 

If it is, it will run a Powershell script to notify you that the battery is low and how much is remaining.
